## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository simply creates a .git folder in the current directory. This
command must be ran in order for git to have a place where commits can be stored.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area provides an intermediate area to track which files in the working
directory will be committed to the repository. This allows the user to have greater
control over which files will be tracked by git.

## How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows only the added files to be committed thus allowing one to
selectively commit files in logical groups. It also provides a way to check which
changes will be included before a commit is performed.

## What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branching is helpful for situations in which a new experiment feature is being added
because it allows for drastic changes to be made to the code while still keeping an
unaltered main branch that will remain stable.

## How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams provide an easy way to map out the way in which a commit relates to
all of the other commits that have been created.
