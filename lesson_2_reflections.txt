## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ititializing a repository simply creates a .git folder in the current directory. This
command must be ran in order for git to have a place where commits can be stored.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do yo uthink it offers?

The staging area provides an itermediate area to track which files in the working
directory will be commited to the repository. This allows the user to have greater
control over which files will be tracked by git.
